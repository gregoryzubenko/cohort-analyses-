## Cohort analyses

Using python, I am building customized RFM clusters of students to evaluate your audience. In adapted clustering, you can choose the following metrics: R - average time to pass one exam, F - completion of courses, M - average number of points received per exam. Describe in detail how you created the clusters. For each RFM segment, plot the boundaries of the recency, frequency, and monetary metrics to interpret these clusters.
